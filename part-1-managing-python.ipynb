    "# Managing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial we will be using [HelioCloud](https://smce.nasa.gov/helio-cloud/) but this part will be a short presentation and discussion around installing Python, the use of virtual environments and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "[As the old XKCD points out:](https://xkcd.com/1987/)\n",
    "\n",
    "![sunpy core summary](./images/python_environment_2x.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is better than it used to be, but it still not perfect and has many pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone is probably familiar with the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and their GUI, [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator).\n",
    "This is a comprehensive collection of Python libraries in one package and makes starting very simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, recently they relicensed their distribution and that caused a major issue within the wider community of National Labs, Research Universities and non-profit organizations.\n",
    "As a result, several companies have blocked being able to access any urls for Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the alternative?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer from the SunPy Project is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the \"conda-forge\" channel provided by the conda-forge project.\n",
    "  conda-forge is a community-led project which creates recipes, hosts infrastructure and distributions for use with `conda`.\n",
    "  They provide a distribution (similar to `miniconda`) called [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) is configured to use the \"conda-forge\" channel by default.\n",
    "  It is also the only way to [install any SunPy Project library](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/tutorial/installation.html#installing-miniforge) via `conda`.\n",
    "- Never setup or use the \"defaults\" channel if you install `miniforge`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A blog post written by Tim de Jager & Ruben Arts [summarizes how conda-forge is free and avoids any vendor lock in.](https://prefix.dev/blog/towards_a_vendor_lock_in_free_conda_experience)\n",
    "\n",
    "## I have Anaconda or Anaconda Navigator already - What should I do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Though, you could get rid of the default channel(s) using the `conda config` command as shown [in this Stack Overflow answer about switching channels from anaconda to conda-forge](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67708768).\n",
    "This is good for new environments but it doesn't remove what you've got already installed (e.g., the `base` environment) and you may be still infringing the Terms of Services for Anaconda.\n",
    "If you have Anaconda Navigator, you have to remove it unless you know that you are not violating the license requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the cleanest method is to completely remove Anaconda and Anaconda Navigator and install [`miniforge`](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/tutorial/installation.html#installing-miniforge).\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no automated way of recreating all of your environments, and [this post about migrating from Anaconda to `miniforge`](https://it.martinos.org/help/migrating-anaconda-miniconda-install-to-a-miniforge-install/) details the steps that one has to follow to migrate."

    "## Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major confusions around Python is the concept of virtual environments (venv).\n",
    "Especially when it comes to Anaconda and the use of \"base\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But before that, what is a virtual enviroment?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A virtual environment is a named, isolated, working copy of Python that that maintains its own files, directories, and paths so that you can work with specific versions of libraries or Python itself without affecting other Python projects.\n",
    "> Virtual environments make it easy to cleanly separate different projects and avoid problems with different dependencies and version requirements across components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a programmer, I use them to isolate works projects that I focused on as I am making changes in several packages at one time.\n",
    "I also view them as disposable, I will delete and recreate them if something breaks, or I want to change to a new version of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally this is not how you will be using this.\n",
    "\n",
    "As researchers, you need two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stability\n",
    "2. Reproducibly \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Python (yearly releases) and the packages that form the foundation of scientific Python move fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "This where creating a separate environment for each major project (on a per paper basis for example) is a good idea.\n",
    "You isolate your work from broader changes and you have a simpler and smaller environment to keep track of if you need to go back.\n",
    "\n",
    "### venv\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically this is handled via the module called [\"venv\"](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv) which for me personally is very confusing to use.\n",
    "There are also a number of different tools which wrap this, or can create their own and that makes getting setup even more confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where conda really shines in my opinion.\n",
    "For the most part, the syntax is simple and it just works.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In the terminal enter the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda create -n yourenvname python=x.x pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you can pick the environment name by changing `yourenvname` and select the Python version you are after.\n",
    "By default this will be the latest one which can be annoying if its really new (<3 months old).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activate your virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate (aka switch) into your virtual environment, simply type the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda activate <yourenvname>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The command prompt will change to indicate which conda environment you are currently in by prepending `(yourenvname)`.\n",
    "To see a list of all your environments, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda env list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Python packages\n",
    "\n",
    "To install additional packages, once you have activated your virtual environment, enter the followingL\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda install package\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Export your virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To export a conda environment, enter the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import another virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To import a conda environment, enter the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deactivate your virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To close your current environment, enter the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delete a no longer needed virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a conda environment, enter the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda remove -n yourenvname\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to do a clean to free up disk space from downloaded packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda clean\n",
    "```"
